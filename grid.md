## Grid Value

- `grid` - generates a block-level grid
- `inline-grid` - generates an inline-level grid
- `subgrid` - if your grid container is itself a grid item (i.e. nested grids), you can use this property to indicate that you want the sizes of its rows/columns to be taken from its parent rather than specifying its own. **`subgrid` is not yet implemented in any browsers, and the specification is subject to change.**
